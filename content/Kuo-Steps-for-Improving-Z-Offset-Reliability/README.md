# Kuo Steps for Improving Z-Offset Reliability
Qidi Plus 4 printers come equipped with nozzle touch and bed proximity sensors to enable automatic z-offset, bed leveling, and per-print meshbed functionality. User expectation is that the printer will automatically level the bed and repeatably set nozzle distance accurately for printing. Unfortunately, stock Plus4 implementaiton is not entirely reliable. Multiple owners have reported unreliable first layers, or even gouged print plates despite ABL sensors. 

I use multiple strategies from the community wiki to improve odds of accurate and repeatable z-offset and bed mesh. To the wiki recommendations, I have added tweaks based upon days of sensor reliablity testing at various temperatures, speeds, and probing distances. An entire chain of things must happen correctly for first layer accuracy. Break any item in the chain, and the result is flawed first layer bed / nozzle positioning. 


# Terms Used
Reading online advice on z-offset, bed tramming, and bed mesh can be confusing because the same phrase, z-offset, is used for mutiple different things. For the purposes of this discussion I define the some terms to differentiate various z-offset meanings. They may not be exactly how Klipper and Qidi firmware implement or name them, but are needed to convey the concepts.


## z-screw-position-count: 
This is the underlying z-screw position that Klipper tracks. It is kept by the system counting and keeping track of how many steps the motors have been moved.


## z-nozzle-touch: 
This is the z at which the system detects nozzle touching print bed. It is the zero point of the z coordinates for printing. 


## z-offset-internal: 
The printer has a formula determined distance that it considers the correct position for first layer when z-offset-user is zero.


## z-offset-user: 
This is the z-offset that users set. It is in added to the z-offset-base. If you set z-offset-user to place bed 0.1 mm below nozzle, the actual bed to nozzle distance is your z-offset-user combined with z-offset-internal.


## stored-Z-offset: 
Qidi firmware tries to store z-offset-user at the end of each print job. This feature is intended to let users manually tweak z-offset via the printer control panel and have their adjustment stored for later print jobs.


## bed-mesh: 
This is an induction probe mapping of bed shape created by probing the print plate. The zero for these measurements is calibrated by the printer measuring induction probe reading vs z-nozzle-touch. After that calibration, all distances from nozzle to bed are done via induction probe rather than nozzle touch. 

The bed mesh measurements are used to moved the bed up/down to compensate for bed height variation. The printer attempts to keep nozzle distance equal to z-offset-internal + z-offset-user. The percent of bed mesh compensation varies with z-height. Typically, printers fade out bed compensation after several layers height printing.

As a KAMP printer, there are actually two bed meshes potentially in use. The default mesh is that saved after performing a "tune" mesh bed operation. That is the whole print bed mesh and can serve as the bed mesh when a KAMP mesh is not available. Print jobs on the Qidi Plus4 typically include a KAMP mesh measurement step wherein a more specific bed mesh of the actual print area is done. The print job then uses the KAMP mesh to do  bed mesh compensation rather than the default mesh.



Note: Because the vast majority of distance measurements are performed using the induction probe which is re-calibrated with nozzle touch, accuracy of BOTH nozzle touch and induction probe are needed for bed mesh, bed z-tilt, and bed mesh compensation. 

NB: Induction probes (and even Beacon probes) do not measure reliably near the edges of the print plate. Also, probe offset and mechanical limits mean the printer can never actually take measurements of bed mesh all the way out to print bed edges. Therefore, bed mesh may be dramatically wrong when printing is at extreme edge of bed.



# Problems on the Qidi Plus 4:


a: Piezo bed sensors at incorrect pre-tension: Nozzle touch sensing becomes unreliable at low PLA bed temperatures, and increasingly worse at high bed temperatures.


b: Piezo bed sensor mechanically damaged or poorly made: Piezo sensor discs are bonded to their brackets using glue. There are reports of a batch of sensor discs having  glue that deteriorates at high temperatures. Also, hard impacts to print bed can overstress mounting glue for the sensor discs. The majority of piezo sensor are okay, but if they break, z-nozzle-touch may not be detected. As a result, the user sees x-carriage lifted during nozzle touch and subsequently suffer a gouged print plate. Z-nozzle-touch was incorrectly detected too high (too late). Once piezo sensors fail, they need to be replaced or possibly repaired via re-bonding.


c: Bed downward mechanical stop is uneven without leveling blocks due to shape of platform bottom: Letting the printer lower bed to bottom, without leveling blocks, does not repeatably bottom out the z screws in same position. Leveling blocks must be used. These should be exactly the same height and provide a SOLID stop for both left and right z-screws. 


d: Z-stepper motor microstepping and driver interpolation settings in firmware 1.6.0 may cause a Klipper issue with accuratetly counting and tracking z position.


e: Induction probe accuracy and reliability are not fully optimized in firmware 1.6.0. The firmware settings for probing distance and speed fail to work properly with some induction probes. The default 5 mm distance and 5 mm/sec speed works for most induction probes, but for some units, the distance especially, is too short. The bed must move far enough to be reliably out of hysteresis range of the induction probe. My measurements suggest that at least 6.5 mm probing distance is needed to be compatible with probes that trigger at a longer distance.


f: Stored-Z-offset unpredictably changes. Users report stored z-offset can mysteriously become zero or seem to stack up over a series of prints. The exact mechanism or circumstances of this happening are not yet known.



# What I Do (After Removing Packing Materials)

## 1. Download and install firmware 1.6.0. 
Everything I describe here is with firmware 1.6.0


## 2. Set Piezo Sensors to Reasonble Pre-tension
<img src="./leftfrontsrcrew.jpg">

Before doing any bed leveling, set bed screw knobs to position the bottom of the plastic knobs to 9-10 mm away from bottom of metal bed plate above. If your printer has just the locking nut (no lock washer), that leaves about three threads visible below lock nut. Once at this position, lock the front left screw in place. Leave that screw alone. Do bed leveling ONLY with the other three screws. That should keep you in good pre-tension range for all four piezos.

# 4. Induction Probing Distance and Speed
My testing at multiple bed temperatures, probing speeds, and distances demonstrates that the firmware 1.6.0 speed and distance are not optimal. Probing distances of 6.5 mm or greater yields fewer pre-triggered sensor errors than the stock 5 mm. Probing speed is less critical, and can actually probe faster than the stock 5 mm/sec.


My settings for [smart_effector] and [bed_mesh] are below. Comments are at my changes.

Before dropping samples down to 1, verify that your speed and distance settings achieve at least four full bed meshes without any out of tolerance repeats seen in console log. Most conservative would be to leave sample count at 2, but I am having good success rate printing with just 1 sample per location with my speed and distance settings. 



# 5. Leveling Blocks
Use whatever whatever SOLID, same height objects you have for initial setup, but
once you have permanent leveling blocks installed, redo your bed screws adjust and "tune" for bed mesh.

Permanent z-leveling blocks by Stew675 is a convenient design. They can be left in place permanently with minimal loss in max vertical printing height. https://www.printables.com/model/1212350-permanent-bed-platform-levelling-blocks-for-the-qi





# 6. Screws_Tilt_Calculate / Bed Left/Right Tramming
Now that we have the Piezo and induction probes optimized with our [smart_effector] and [bed_mesh] changes, we can use the probes to help with bed leveling.

Do the steps in https://github.com/qidi-community/Plus4-Wiki/tree/main/content/Screws-Tilt-Adjust to enable Screws_Tilt_Calculate. It is faster than working with paper or feeler gauges. 

Tim Carroll suggests adding some extra parameters to improve probing in the printer.cfg SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE macro. He addes probing speed, distance, and increases number of sampling and reports more repeatable probing during screw adjustment. Following his example and using my probing speeds and distances you would change the macro to...


```
[gcode_macro SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE]
rename_existing: _SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE_BASE
gcode:
    { action_respond_info("starting screw rotation calculation...") }
    M141 S0 # disable chamber heater (see https://github.com/qidi-community/Plus4-Wiki/tree/main/content/chamber-heater-issue)
    M4031
    G28
    _SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE_BASE horizontal_move_z=5 sample_retract_dist=8 samples=3
```


I perform Screws_Tilt_Calculate (and bedmeshes) with print bed at 90C because that is my most common print bed temp. Carroll further suggests also setting nozzle at 140C to emulate printer conditions during bedmesh probing. If you typically print hotter, consider doing screw tilt adjust and bedmesh at your elevated bed temp. Doing this at room temp gives a different result than when performed at printing temperature.

NOTE: We already set left front screw to known good piezo pre-tension. LEAVE THAT LEFT FRONT SCREW ALONE and you will tend end up with other three also at reasonable pretension for piezos. Be leary of big adjustments tightening the adjustment knobs more than one full rotation.

Once you complete Screws_Tilt_Calculate, go into Tune section to do bedmesh. If the mesh looks level enough, save it. Otherwise, repeat Screws_Tilt_Calculate.



# 7. Default Bedmesh and Probing Tolerance Check.
Once screws_tilt_calculate has your bed leveled (all four screws indicated as green), go into Fluidd's "tune" to perform bedmesh. Do so with bed at your usual printing temperature. Examine the mesh to see if there are residual tilts to correct. If so, go back and fine adjust bed screws as needed.

Also, pay attention to the console log and watch for out of tolerance retries. If you cannot get the printer to complete bedmeshes without tolerance warnings, go back to step 4 and change probing speed 1 mm/sec slower and increase probing distance by 0.5 mm. Once the printer has been restarted, reheat bed to temp and repeat "tune" for bedmesh again.

Once the printer can complete four bed meshes in a row without out of tolerance reports, you can consider setting probing count down to 1 for more speed.

Don't forget to save a completed bedmesh as the default bedmesh. 



# 8. Make z-offset-user and Stored z_offset Permanently ZERO
I make these permanently zero to avoid the bug that unpredictably changes z-offset.
In the next step, we will store z-offset-internal explicity for the printer. 
That lets us permanently and specify what the printer is using for distance between bed and nozzle during first layer.

See wiki Making Z_offset Permanent for background understanding, but do NOT do the changes presented there. 
https://github.com/qidi-community/Plus4-Wiki/tree/main/content/making-z-offset-permanent

I only follow its instructions for disabling storage of z_offset and for making it zero in saved_variables. 

Do NOT alter smart_effector as described in the wiki (assuming you wisth to follow my way of specifying and storing z-offset)
This is how I do thingsl..


In Saved_variables.cfg 
Make sure that the stored z_offset is zero.

    z_offset = 0


Next, prevent automatic storage of z_offset
Open gcode_macro.cfg

We disable storage of z_offset from PRINT_END and safe_zoffset by commenting out three lines in each of two macros.

```
[gcode_macro PRINT_END]
gcode:
#    {% if printer.gcode_move.homing_origin.z < 0.5 %}
#       SAVE_VARIABLE VARIABLE=z_offset VALUE={printer.gcode_move.homing_origin.z}
#    {% endif %}



[gcode_macro save_zoffset]
gcode:
#    {% if printer.gcode_move.homing_origin.z < 0.5 %}
#       SAVE_VARIABLE VARIABLE=z_offset VALUE={printer.gcode_move.homing_origin.z}
#    {% endif %}

```


# 9. Set Desired Z-offset for 1st Layer.
I set and store z-offset between bed and nozzle directly in the formula that specifies z-offset-internal

Find the section in gcode_macro for get_zoffset


````
[gcode_macro get_zoffset]

    G1 Z30 F600
    QIDI_PROBE_PIN_2
    m204 S10000

````



Notice the formula....
       
    {% set p=(-0.15 + printer.gcode_move.homing_origin.z)|float %}


The -0.15 means the bed should be placed 0.15 mm below z_nozzle_touch for first print layer.

-0.10 would be closer to nozzle

-0.20 would be farther away from nozzle

Recall that thse distance measurements are being performed by printer using the induction probe. Higher temps tend to make induction probes trigger at a shorter distance. So, consider setting bed a little further below nozzle if printing is going to be with high temp filaments. 

Save and Restart for changs to take place.

You will need to experiment to determine your best offset. One way is to manually tweak z-0ffset while printing. Then, remember that value and use that to adjust your formula value.

Each of my printers does best with a slightly different formula z-offset-internal, but they are between -0.12 and -0.15 for my four Plus4 printers despite printing a range for filaments from PLA (205c nozzle / 60c bed) to Polycarbonate (325c nozzle / 115c bed)



=========================

This concludes the changes I make for better piezo and induction probe performance.
