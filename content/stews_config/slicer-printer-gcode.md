# Slicer Side Printer Gcode

Here's my slicer-side printer start/end/layer change gcode to match my printer config

It should be noted that if you are still running `xindi` (if you don't know what that is,
then the answer to that question for you is **YES**), then **DO NOT** call `PRINT_END` from
the end print macro gcode as `xindi` will do that for you automatically.
