# Suggested Configuration Settings for Orca Slicer

## Orca Slicer

Orce Slicer main be downloaded here: https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases

While the following profiles and suggestions are focused around OrcaSlicer (which is the slicer I personally use for all my 3D Printing slicing needs)
many of these suggestions should be able to be imported into QidiStudio as well due to the strong similarities between OrcaSlicer and QidiStudio, 

As of [v2.2.0-beta-2](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases/tag/v2.2.0-beta2) (or newer) Orca Slicer now offers a printer profile for the Qidi Plus 4.
